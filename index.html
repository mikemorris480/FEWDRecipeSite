        <p id="justified">Bouillabaisse is a traditional Proven√ßal fish stew originating from the port city of Marseille, France. It is a flavorful dish made with a variety of fish, shellfish, and aromatic herbs. Alton Brown's "Positively, Absolutely, Not Real Bouillabaisse" is a playful twist on the classic <span id="french-text">French</span> seafood stew. While it captures the essence of bouillabaisse with its rich fish stock, aromatic saffron, and a medley of seafood like mussels, lobster, and various fish fillets, it deliberately deviates from tradition. The key distinction lies in the absence of rascasse, the scorpion fish that is a hallmark of authentic bouillabaisse. This omission is what makes Alton's version "not real," as rascasse <img src="https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1244834753/photo/red-scorpionfish-scorpaena-sow.jpg?s=1024x1024&w=is&k=20&c=flEpnhQt9AQ3ZhQANOaTXbdO5V6DnrbJzJbo3f15_rc=" alt="Rascasse" id="rascasse-image"> is essential to the dish's identity and flavor profile. Instead, Alton's recipe embraces creativity, offering a delicious and approachable alternative for those who want to enjoy the spirit of bouillabaisse without adhering strictly to its traditional roots.</p>

                <span id="step-number">1</span>
                <p><span id="minor-instructions">For the fish stock:</span> Rinse the fish heads and place in a tall 6-quart pot with tails, bones, lobster shell, bay leaves, 1 teaspoon sea salt, black peppercorns, and water. Place over high heat, cover, and bring to a boil. Decrease the heat to maintain a bare simmer and cook for 25 minutes. Strain, discard solids, and set the stock aside.</p>
                <hr id="line">
                <span id="step-number">2</span>
                <p><span id="minor-instructions">To make the stew:</span> Place 1/4 cup olive oil in a clean 6-quart pot and set over medium heat. When the oil shimmers, add the onions, fennel, and 1/2 teaspoon sea salt. Saute until semi-translucent, about 10 minutes, stirring frequently. Deglaze the pan with the wine and scrape any bits from the bottom of the pan. Add the reserved fish stock, tomatoes, parsley, orange peel and saffron, if desired. Place over high heat, cover, and bring to a boil. Decrease the heat to maintain a simmer and cook for 15 minutes. Increase the heat to high. Add the remaining 1/4 cup olive oil, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon sea salt, fish, garlic, and cayenne pepper. Boil rapidly, uncovered, for 5 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove the pot from the heat, add the mussels and lobster, cover, and let stand until the fish is cooked through and the mussels open, 2 to 4 minutes. Discard any unopened mussels.</p>
