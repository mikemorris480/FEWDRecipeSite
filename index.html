            <h1 id="centered">Positively, Absolutely, Not Real Bouillabaisse</h1>
            <p id="justified">Alton Brown's "Positively, Absolutely, Not Real Bouillabaisse" is a playful twist on the classic French seafood stew. While it captures the essence of bouillabaisse with its rich fish stock, aromatic saffron, and a medley of seafood like mussels, lobster, and various fish fillets, it deliberately deviates from tradition. The key distinction lies in the absence of rascasse, the scorpion fish that is a hallmark of authentic bouillabaisse. This omission is what makes Alton's version "not real," as rascasse is essential to the dish's identity and flavor profile. Instead, Alton's recipe embraces creativity, offering a delicious and approachable alternative for those who want to enjoy the spirit of bouillabaisse without adhering strictly to its traditional roots.</p>
